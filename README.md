# Campus Palate

## Introduction
Welcome to Campus Palate, a user-friendly interface designed to empower college students, especially freshmen, in making informed dietary choices at their campus dining centers. Our goal is to help you meet your dietary goals and maintain a healthy lifestyle during your college journey.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Campus Palate came from the experiences of our team members who, as vegetarians, faced challenges in finding suitable food options on campus. This motivated us to create a platform that provides students with information about their dietary options, helping them make choices that align with their preferences and restrictions.

## What it does
Campus Palate takes user-inputted dietary requirements and preferences to recommend suitable dining halls on campus. It suggests meals that align with users' goals and helps them avoid allergens. The platform also provides information about various food options available on campus, ensuring students never get bored while following their dietary preferences.

## How we built it
Campus Palate is built using Python, integrating a Python program with CSV files from Excel using the Pandas library. The CSV files, containing nutritional information and menu details, are stored in the same directory as the Python file. The code will be available on GitHub for reference and collaboration.

## Challenges we ran into
One major challenge was the time constraint, as collecting data from multiple dining halls and researching nutritional values within 24 hours was demanding. Initially planning to use "Tembo" as a database management system (PostgreSQL) posed a challenge due to its novelty, leading us to switch to Excel. Collaborating on a software-based project required efficient coding, and integrating the back end with the front end was a complex task.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite challenges, we successfully adapted to unforeseen circumstances. We take pride in our ability to switch plans smoothly, store necessary data on Excel as a database management solution, and achieve our goals for the weekend.

## What we learned
Our main takeaway was the importance of testing plans on a smaller scale before proceeding extensively into a project. Additionally, having a backup plan and thinking ahead can be crucial. Learning from these experiences will guide our approach to future projects.

## What's next for Campus Palate
Our future plans include implementing Campus Palate on the main campus of the University of Cincinnati, making it accessible to all UC students. We aim to host Campus Palate on our website, expanding its availability beyond local functions. Ultimately, we envision Campus Palate being adopted by universities across the United States to support students in making healthier dietary choices on their campuses.
